# 0x08. Making Change


## Project Overview

The "0. Change comes from within" project is designed to solve the classic coin change problem using Python. The goal is to determine the minimum number of coins required to make a given total amount using a list of coin denominations. This project involves applying dynamic programming and greedy algorithms to achieve an efficient and correct solution.

## Problem Statement

Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total.

### Function Prototype

```python
def makeChange(coins, total):
```
